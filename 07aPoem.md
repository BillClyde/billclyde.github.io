## Toki Pona: A Poem

mi jo e kili  
ona li pona  
ona li lili  
mi moku lili e kili lili

I have a fruit  
It is good  
It is small  
I nibble the little fruit  

### An important note:

> in **toki pona** the verb 'to be' does not exist  

> **li** and **e** mean nothing by themselves but give a sentence structure  
> The principle function of **li** is to indicate that the preceding word is the subject.  
> When the subject is **mi** or **sina**,  **li** is understood and omitted.  
> **e** joins actions and objects together: *verb* **e** *object*
