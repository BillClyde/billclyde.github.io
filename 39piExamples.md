> **pi** does not mean "of"

Most of the time you can think of **pi** as "of" and there is no problem, but **pi** is only used as parenthesis to avoid confusion.  

The danger of using **pi** as "of" is that you will use it when it is not needed as in:

**~~jan pi ma~~**

You probably ment to say "man of the field" but it was not necessary to use **pi** as there is no confusion to be avoided. Just say:

jan ma
: farmer, peasant (man of the field)

> Usually it only necessary to use **pi** if there are two or more words after the initial noun
