## Toki Pona: pi

> Suppose you want to say bar in **toki pona** and you decide to say this:

tomo telo nasa

> thinking that you are saying "room alcohol". But remember adjectives are grouped from left to right

((tomo telo) nasa)
: crazy bathroom

> To say "bar", you need to use **pi** to group them correctly

tomo pi telo nasa
: bar, (room of alcohol)

> **pi** is very important to avoid such confusion.
