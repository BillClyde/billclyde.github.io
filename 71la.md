## Toki Pona: la

**la** is the last separator word along with **li**, **e** and **pi** that is used in **toki pona**.
Like the other separator words, there is no literal translation in English but the separator words are very useful.

> The basic idea of **la** is that it is used to join two sentences so that the second sentence provides context for the first sentence.

We will distinguish three uses for **la** and will explain each one, but the basic idea remains the same
