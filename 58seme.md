## Toki Pona: seme #2

> as why along with **tan**

sina olin e mi tan seme?
: Why do you love me?

sina ike tan seme?
: Why are you bad?

> as what but with a sense of which

sina kama tan ma seme?
: Where do you come from?

lipu ni li kule seme?
: What color is that sheet?

nasin sewi seme li pona tawa sina?
: Which religion do you like?

> together with **kepeken** it means "how" or "with what"

sina tawa kepeken seme?
: How are you going?

sina pali e ni kepeken seme?
: How do you do that?

**seme** may seem difficult because you are used to changing the order of the words in the questions.
With a bit of practice you will find it becomes much easier.  
One good trick to check if you made a good question is to replace **seme** with **ni** and think of the question as a statement. If the statement does not make sense it is probably not a good question.
